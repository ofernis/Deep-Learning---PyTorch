    "\\mat{S} = \\mat{X} \\mat{W}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "2. The reason we put the samples in the rows of $\\mat{X}$ and not columns (as is the convention in some texts) is\n",
    "   because that's the convention in the pytorch library: the batch dimension is always the first one. This has many\n",
